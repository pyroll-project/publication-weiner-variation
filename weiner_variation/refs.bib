  abstract = {Following upon the general theory in Part I, a considerable simplification is here introduced in the treatment of the case where the grain centers of the new phase are randomly distributed. Also, the kinetics of the main types of crystalline growth, such as result in polyhedral, plate-like and lineal grains, are studied. A relation between the actual transformed volume V and a related extended volume V1 ex is derived upon statistical considerations. A rough approximation to this relation is shown to lead, under the proper conditions, to the empirical formula of Austin and Rickett. The exact relation is used to reduce the entire problem to the determination of V1 ex, in terms of which all other quantities are expressed. The approximate treatment of the beginning of transformation in the isokinetic range is shown to lead to the empirical formula of Krainer and to account quantitatively for certain relations observed in recrystallization phenomena. It is shown that the predicted shapes for isothermal transformation-time curves correspond well with the experimental data.},

  abstract = {The theory of the preceding papers is generalized and the notation simplified. A cluster of molecules in a stable phase surrounded by an unstable phase is itself unstable until a critical size is reached, though for statistical reasons a distribution of such clusters may exist. Beyond the critical size, the cluster tends to grow steadily. The designation ``nuclei'' or ``grains'' is used according as the clusters are below or above the critical size. It is shown that a comprehensive description of the phenomena of phase change may be summarized in Phase Change, Grain Number and Microstructure Formulas or Diagrams, giving, respectively, the transformed volume, grain, and microstructure densities as a function of time, temperature, and other variables. To facilitate the deduction of formulas for these densities the related densities of the ``extended'' grain population are introduced. The extended population is that system of interpenetrating volumes that would obtain if the grains granulated and grew through each other without mutual interference. The extended densities are much more readily derivable from an analysis of the fundamental processes of granulation and growth. It is shown that, under very general circumstances, the densities of the actual grain population may be expressed simply in terms of the extended population.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the present paper is to predict the grain size of steel during the hot-rolling process. The basis represents a macroscopic simulation system that can cope with temperatures, stresses and strains of steel in a complete continuous rolling mill, including reversible pre-rolling and finishing rolling with several tenths of rolling passes. The grain size models, newly introduced in the present paper, are one-way coupled to the macro-scale calculations performed with the slice model assumption. Macroscale solution is based on a novel radial basis function collocation method. This numerical method is truly meshless by involving the space discretization in arbitrarily distributed nodes without meshing. A new efficient node generation algorithm is implemented in the present paper and demonstrated for irregular domains of the slice as they appear in different rolling passes. Multiple grain size prediction models are considered. Grain size prediction models are based on empirical relations. Austenite grain size at each rolling pass as well as the ferrite grain size at the end of rolling are predicted in this simulation. It is also shown that based on the rolling schedule, it is highly likely that recrystallization takes place at each pass throughout a continuous rolling mill. The simulation system is coded as a user-friendly computer application for industrial use based on programing language C\# and an open source developer platform .NET and runs on regular personal computers The computational time for a typical rolling simulation is usually less than one hour and can thus be straightforwardly used to optimize the rolling mill design in a reasonable time.},

Finite element method was employed to model plastic flow and heat transfer in the deformed material, and heat transfer during cooling to ambient temperature. The numerical calculation gave an assessment of the strain, strain rate and temperature distributions in the work piece. This allowed the prediction of the austenite microstructure evolution during the process. Finally, the relationships describing the microstructuremechanical properties were used to quantitatively characterize the influence of processing parameters on strength of rods after rolling.},

  abstract = {Four low carbon bainitic steels were compression tested under interrupted and continuous loading conditions. These materials were made from a base steel containing 0.0260/0C, to which were added one or both of 0.055\% Nb and/or 30 ppm ofB. In this way, the influence on the rate of recrystallization of additions of: (i) Nb; (ii) B ; and (iii) Nb + B was assessed independently. The recrystallization kinetics of the hot worked austenite were determined for prestrains of 0.12, 0.25 and 0.50 in the temperature range 90o-1100°C. The results are presented in the form of percentage softening vs log time plots and of RTT (recrystallization-time-temperature) diagrams. The observations indicate that the addition of B is most effective in retarding recrystallization in the presence of Nb. Furthermore, the degree of retardation is influenced by both the prestrain and the temperature. The kinetics of recovery and recrystallization are characterized in terms of the Avrami equation; the influence of prestrain, temperature and alloy composition on the coefficients and exponents is described.},

  abstract = {The design of modern construction materials with heterogeneous microstructures requires a numerical model that can predict the distribution of microstructural features instead of average values. The accuracy and reliability of such models depend on the proper identification of the coefficients for a particular material. This work was motivated by the need for advanced experimental data to identify stochastic material models. Extensive experiments were performed to supply data to identify a model of austenite microstructure evolution in steels during hot deformation and during the interpass times between deformations. Two sets of tests were performed. The first set involved hot compressions with a nominal strain of 1. The second set involved hot compressions with lower nominal strains, followed by holding at the deformation temperature for different times. Histograms of austenite grain size after each test were measured and used in the identification procedure. The stochastic model, which was developed elsewhere, was identified. Inverse analysis with the objective function based on the distance between the measured and calculated histograms was applied. Validation of the model was performed for the experiments, which were not used in the identification. The distance between the measured and calculated histograms was determined for each test using the Bhattacharyya metric and very low values were obtained. As a case study, the model with the optimal coefficients was applied to the simulation of the selected industrial hot-forming process.},

  abstract = {Groove rolling is one of the main process routes for the production of metal long products, such as bars, beams, wires and rods. In this process, a workpiece is deformed by two or more rotating rolls to reduce the cross-section achieve a desired cross-section shape. The shape is determined by the contour of the rolls’ surfaces, called the groove or calibre. The process is usually accomplished in multiple steps, each called a pass. The industry is currently under heavy pressure to optimize its processes regarding energy consumption while maintaining or increasing product quality. The introduction of new materials and alloys challenges production and technology engineers. In the past decades, numerical simulation tools have become an integral part of process development and maintenance. There are used to estimate forces and engine torques, as well as geometrical and microstructural evolution of the workpiece for a given pass sequence and input workpiece geometry and material. This knowledge is important to design or optimize a process, identify sources of errors, increase product quality or extend the product portfolio.},

The justification of using multiscale and simplified models in simulations of manufacturing of DP steel products is discussed. Multiscale techniques are described and their applications to modeling annealing and stamping are shown. This approach is costly and should be used in specific applications only. Models based on the JMAK equation are an alternative. Physical simulations of the continuous annealing were conducted for validation of the models. An analysis of the computing time and predictive capabilities of the models allowed to conclude that the modified JMAK equation gives good results as far as prediction of volume fractions after annealing is needed. Contrary, a multiscale model is needed to analyze the distributions of strains in the ferritic-martensitic microstructure. The idea of simplification of multiscale models is presented, as well.},

  abstract = {Producing assemblies that experience little to no rework during assembly fit-up is a perennial challenge in offsite construction. While the traditional response has been to solve geometric issues onsite at the expense of large rework costs, manufacturing optimisation techniques can mitigate these issues upstream. Tolerance analysis is one such method that is widely used in manufacturing to predict if problems will occur from the accumulation of tolerances and dimensional variability. This article demonstrates Monte Carlo tolerance simulation on a prefabricated construction assembly, where variations up to 37 mm are identified compared to as-built deviations which range up to 30 mm. Process optimisation is also explored, where risk of rework related to dimensional variability is reduced by 65.6\% through selection of alternate fabrication processes. To compare the Monte Carlo method to traditional analysis methods, a simplified 1-D tolerance analysis is used. Compared to an as-built deviation of roughly 11 mm, the Monte Carlo method produces a conservative value of 15.4 mm, while other traditional methods are either overly conservative (worst-case tolerance chain has a deviation of 19.8 mm), or overly ambitious (root sum square tolerance chain has a deviation of 4.6 mm). Tolerance analysis through Monte Carlo simulation is shown to be a proactive design tool with several key advantages for prefabricated and offsite construction. First, complex three-dimensional geometric interactions can be readily modelled using very basic tolerance configurations. Secondly, potential misalignments at key connection points can be identified and quantified in terms of a probability distribution of variation. Finally, design improvements can be achieved by comparing alternate construction processes to mitigate the risk of assembly rework.},

  abstract = {Recovery processes tend to counteract the effects of work hardening during plastic deformation at high temperatures and at strain rates ranging from those of slow creep to those of rapid hot working operations. However, in metals in which recovery is relatively slow, sufficient stored energy can be accumulated to cause the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization during deformation once a critical strain is exceeded. This process then occurs repeatedly with continued straining. If any metal that has been deformed at high temperatures by a dislocation mechanism is held at temperature after deformation, static recrystallization tends to occur with time. The effects of dynamic and static recrystallization on microstructure and on the flow stress or creep rate of the metal are considered in this paper and particular attention is given to the range of deformation conditions under which these recrystallization processes are expected to occur. When metals deform plastically by crystal slip at elevated temperatures, the work hardening produced by deformation tends to be counteracted by recovery processes. These recovery processes cause rearrangement and annihilation of dislocations so that, as strain increases, the dislocations tend to form into two dimensional subgrain walls. In some metals and alloys the recovery entirely balances work hardening, and steady state is achieved and can be maintained to large strains before fracture occurs. In other metals in which recovery is less rapid, certain conditions of stress and temperature of deformation can result in the accumulation of sufficiently high local differences in dislocation density to nucleate recrystallization during deformation. This recrystallization is referred to as dynamic recrystallization to distinguish it from the recrystallization that can occur in all metals when deformation is discontinued but the elevated temperature is maintained, or when deformation is carried out at low temperature and the metal is subsequently annealed. In this paper, both types of recrystallization and their effects on deformation behaviour and microstructure will be outlined and the range of deformation conditions under which they are likely to occur will be considered.},

The equations have been checked against measurements made when rolling pure lead at room temperatures, and against the results of the experiments on steel at elevated temperatures carried out at Holfors.

  abstract = {The knowledge of the flow behavior of metallic alloys subjected to hot forming operations has particular interest for metallurgists in the practice of industrial forming processes involving high temperatures (e.g., rolling, forging, and/or extrusion operations). Dynamic recrystallisation (DRX) occurs during high temperature forming over a wide range of metals and alloys, and it is known to be a powerful tool that can be used to control the microstructure and mechanical properties. Therefore, it is important to know, particularly in low stacking fault energy materials, the precise time at which DRX is available to act. Under a constant strain rate condition, and for a given temperature, such a time is defined as a critical strain (εc). Unfortunately, this critical value is not always directly measurable on the flow curve; as a result, different methods have been developed to derive it. Focused on carbon and microalloyed steels subjected to laboratory-scale testing, in the present work, the state of art on the critical strain for the initiation of DRX is reviewed and summarized. A review of the different methods and expressions for assessing the critical strain is also included. The collected data are well suited to feeding constitutive models and computational codes.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Rolling simulation, especially for groove rolling, is heavily dominated by use of finite element methods, but simulating a full pass sequence often takes several hours. Simpler models offer high-speed simulation within seconds at the expense of resolution and accuracy. In mechanical engineering, Monte-Carlo approaches are well known for analysis of fabrication tolerances in component assembly. By usage of fast simulation cores, this technique becomes available for analysis of process variations in groove rolling, since computational costs are crucial due to the need of hundreds or thousands of simulation runs. Rolling process variations can be classified in two groups: first, variations of the input material, such as actual dimensions, temperature and microstructure state; second variations occurring during processing, such as transport times, environment temperature and tool wear. The regarded process was the operation of the experimental semi-continuous rolling plant at the Institute of Metal Forming (IMF). Simulations were carried out by use of the open source rolling framework PyRolL, developed at IMF. The main part of process parameters was considered as constant, but some were described as a statistical distribution. For each simulation run a set of actual sample values of the distributed parameters was drawn using a random number generator. Selected result values were described by use of statistical methods to analyze the variational behavior of the process in behalf of the two variation classes.},
